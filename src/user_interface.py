Need to read in data for package file?
How to code for the special cases
Programming environment? does that just mean IDE, OS and python version?
Do we have to use a hash table for part D? Or can we use a tree?
What does a self-adjusting hash table look like?
What does "takes the following components as input and returns the corresponding data elements" mean?
It needs to be searchable on all those fields?
How does searching the package hash table by ID help me?

To find what's happening at a specific time, have the program go to completion.
Then compare all the delivery times to the time in question
